MANAGEMENT DETAILS  
Project title: Macroinvertebrates from River Po catchment  
Database managers: Riccardo Fornaroli  
Temporal coverage: the present data set refers to a decade (2007-2018) of monitoring activities carried on by the Environmental Agencies on the River Po and its tributaries.  
Record basis: Mainly preserved specimens.  
Sampling methods: The data set was created by collating different data sets included in storage databases and managed by several Environmental Agencies operating in Northern Italy.  
Funding grants: no funding grants were received   

GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE  
Study area: the rivers considered are part of the River Po network. They cover the Northern part of Italy crossing different Administrative Regions (Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Lombardy, Liguria, Veneto, Trentino, and Emilia-Romagna) including mostly the Subalpine area and the Po Plain.  
Bounding box: min Longitude: 6.71363 - max Longitude: 11.29543, min Latitude: 44.11007 - max Latitude: 46.49150, min Altitude: 10 - max Altitude: 2,280. 
Sampling design: The data set was created including all the available records (biotic on macroinvertebrates and abiotic) on the River Po and its tributaries.  
Habitat type: The considered rivers cover natural, artificial (channel), or partially modified by anthropic infrastructures rivers flowing through the Po Plain.  
Biogeographic region: Alpine, Continental and Mediterranean (EEA, 2017)  
Country: Italy  
Quality control for geographic data: Quality control was performed using:  
i)	Google satellite identification of rivers and sampling sites;  
ii)	Geographic coordinates format, coordinates within country/provincial boundaries;  
iii)	 absence of ASCII anomalous characters in the data set were additionally controlled.  

TAXONOMIC COVERAGE  
General description: The data set includes records of river macroinvertebrates. The checklist presents taxa (mainly, at family level) arranged and updated to December 2018 according to the Fauna Europaea classification (2020) (de Jong et al., 2014).  
Taxonomic ranks: macroinvertebrates are a heterogeneous group of aquatic organisms visible to the naked eye without employing optical instruments, living in contact with sediments on the bottom of lotic and lentic ecosystems. Macroinvertebrates include immature and adult stages of many different types of invertebrates, such as aquatic insects, crustaceans, molluscs, annelids, flatworms, and cnidarians.  
Taxonomic methods: These methods include the revision of names, and the delimitation of taxa following Fauna Europaea (https://fauna-eu.org/) as a reference.  
Taxon specialist: The first author is responsible for the data management. The authors are not responsible for the identifications carried out by operators of the Environmental Agencies.  
Quality control for taxonomic data: Record validation and cleaning using Fauna Europaea were based on several steps and divided into: a) data check for spelling errors, b) data standardization (check of nomenclatural changes or synonyms), and c) data cleaning and validation for taxonomic reliability and taxonomic consistency.
